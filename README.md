# Weather Forecast

## Description

**Weather Forecast** is a responsive application built using **Angular**, **Axios** and **Open-Meteo**. It transforms user-inputted **city names** into coordinates for forecast data retrieval and fetches real-time weather data using the **[Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/)**.

**Note:** This project is intended to be a portfolio project, which demonstrates best practices in Front-end/Angular development and responsive design.


## Used Tech Stack

- **Angular**
- **Node**
- **TypeORM**
- **Axios**
- **Open-Meteo**

## Features

- üîç Search weather by city name
- üìç Convert input city to latitude & longitude for API query
- üå°Ô∏è View current weather condition
- üìÜ See daily or hourly forecasts
- üîÑ Switch temperature display between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error handling for invalid inputs

## Project setup

### Environment Variables

This section will be finished soon.

### Install required packages

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

**Note:** Default port is _4200_. If you changed the port, use that port instead.

### Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

### Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
